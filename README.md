# Team02 Machine Learning

This repository contains machine learning models and algorithms for autonomous vehicle perception systems developed by Team 02.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of machine learning solutions for various perception tasks in autonomous driving:

- Lane Detection: Computer vision and ML algorithms for identifying lane markings
- Object Detection: Detection and classification of various objects (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, etc.)
